# solarsystem_sim
A quick, simple simulation of the orbit of the planets and moons in the soul system

Solar System is a coursework project for my 2nd year of university. Titled advanced porgramming, the module 
that this coursework was graded for focused on buuilding on the fundamentals of coding learnt in first year. This project especially placed 
much emphasis on mkakin sure our code was modular, and pretty (for lack of a better word). 

With the nature of this project and building a solar system using similar objects, it gave me a good opportunity to practise
and become familiar with inheritance, encapsulation especially along with other OOPs. It was a pleasantly eye-opening experience as it made
me look at my code in a completely different way and made me conscious of it's design for the first time in my life.

A lot of the heavy loading in terms of graphics was done by our lecturer so I only had to focus on creating a solution as simple as possible, in as modular 
a way as I could at the time.
